<div>Abstract</div><div>This article discusses how to keep the Earth's climate moderate, through human behaviors that can cause climate warming as welle as global warming. Because there are vital rays emitted from the heart, resulting from behaviors such as eating some food and drink (e.g., predatory or nail meat, Unclean, and insects, as well as some of the negative immoral actions), that the researchers did not addressed in their research on climate change.</div><div>And also, assumption are developed by which we can identify the most harmful causes of their ability to make chemical changes in the atmosphere (e.g., dispersing cloud particles or capturing droplets from falling) either by multiple rays or by producing free radical such as (NO). Because there are biorays emitted from the heart, resulting from behaviors such as eating some food (e.g., predatory or nail meat, Unclean, and insects, as well as some of the negative ethical actions), that the researchers did not addressed in their research, when they discuss climate change issues.</div><div></div><div>&lt;h1&gt;Introduction&lt;/h1&gt;</div><div>In the beginning, we are determined by the effects of climate change and the resulting disasters such as melting of ice and the spread of deadly epidemics and others. That is why scientists have made great efforts to address this phenomenon (climate change). So I have liked to add a matter that has never been addressed — the biological rays of organisms that result from certain behaviors and that have a role in the occurrence of climatic problems — that many of us do not know. Because of the density of the world population as well as the increasing appetite for eating foods that have a negative energy in the heart and after that emitted radiation affects the surrounding environment as well as the particles of the atmosphere. The article deals with the idea of the presence of a bio-system in the air that circulates chemical waste and prevents the accumulation of greenhouse gases. This system is affected by the bio-waves emitted by the hearts more than the impact of fossil fuel residues. As the accumulation of fossil fuel residues is only due to a bug in that system and this led to the accumulation. That is why we are looking for the ambiguous biological side of this universe and the atmosphere of the Earth, which has a reciprocal interaction with organisms.</div><div>&lt;h1.1&gt;Hypothesis&lt;/h1.1&gt;</div><div>1. For every quantum metabolism action has a horizontal magnetic reaction, that is either a gravitational or a heterogeneous effect, both of which have opposite magnetic properties.</div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div>&lt;h2&gt;Mutual influence between organisms and the surrounding environment&lt;/h2&gt;</div><div>We must make the Earth's climate better, through our food and our behavior. For this, I suppose that, these vital emissions cause the creation of certain bacteria, that play a chemical role in breaking down chemical bonds (decomposition of elements), or in the stabilization of ozone (O3).</div><div>Furthermore, climate warming is directly proportional to sins and is inversely proportional to the distance between them. “The fact that the heart’s electromagnetic field (ECG) can be measured anywhere on the surface of the body and also several feet away from the body, coupled with the recent discovery that this field can become more coherent as the individual shifts to a sincerely loving or caring state, prompted us to investigate the possibility that the field generated by the human heart may be the source of the energy exchanged between practitioner and patient in many healing prac-tices”(&lt;cite class="Itx_cote" data-bib-text="@articale{McCraty, Rollin, et al. 1998,</div><div>Url = {<a href="https://www.questia.com/read/96799351/brain-and-values-is-a-biological-science-of-values">https://www.questia.com/read/96799351/brain-and-values-is-a-biological-science-of-values</a></div><div>},</div><div>Year= 1998,</div><div>Publisher = {Lawrence Erlbaum Associates},</div><div>Place of publication = {Mahwah, NJ},</div><div>Pages = {359--379},</div><div>Author1 = {Rollin McCraty}</div><div>Author2 = {Mike Atkinson}</div><div>Author3 = {Dana Tomasino}</div><div>Author4 = {William A.

Therefore, the field of the electromagnetic of the heart is a source of energy exchange between humans and the environment as well. Thus, the hearts act as nuclear factor, which emitting waves that play a biological role in changing the Earth's climate. This means that these emissions can cause biological changes in the atmosphere in terms of chemical reactions such as breaking down of certain bonds or production other — so that the “greenhouse gases” may accumulate or be recycled (absorbed) and so on.</div><div>This leads us to assume that the biological filter system (e.g., the human urinary system, etc), that removes all negative particles in the atmosphere — and thus, keeps the atmosphere clean.</div><div>However, when the system is defective due to the impact of emissions of the heart (resulting from the accumulation of quantum sins), it will be impaired as in the case of urinary or lymphatic system infections — thus, accumulating harmful particles in the atmosphere, resulting in climate change or global warming, as a result of the mutual influence between humans and the universe (as like reductase oxidation reactions). Lets assume that, when you do not have diabetic, the more sugar or meals that containing sugar will not affect your health, because there is excretory system which play a role in recycling and the surplus is eliminated and so on. Moreover, the processes of filtering removal of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases, from the atmosphere, and recycling according to certain biological processes. This is what we call the excretory system of the atmosphere as it is in the human body, such as the liver, urine system, etc. The atmosphere contains excretory system that purify the air and dispose of the greenhouse gases either by absorption or otherwise. However, when the system is damaged by electromagnetic, electrostatic and ultrasound waves of the hearts, will lead to the accumulation of “greenhouses” as in diabetes.</div><div></div><div>&lt;h3&gt;How food affects the environment&lt;/h3&gt;</div><div>So I can conclude that according to the hypothesis. For every quantum metabolism action has a horizontal magnetic reaction, that is either a gravitational or a heterogeneous effect. For this, that reaction remains in the form of multidimensional peripheral energy, which plays a role in the phenotype modification. Moreover, the energy of hearts is one of the main causes of climate change (e.g., waves of the hearts are able to break down bonds of clouds particles). So we must avoid sins such as killing people, injustice, violence, eating predators, pigs, frogs and donkeys, etc. Because these quanta action translate in the heart into negative quanta which has emission of infrasonic, that affect the process of formation. Thus, the rays of the heart (infrasonic, electromagnetic), play a role in the processes of molecular structure in the universe, leading to the process of quantum confinement of water (atomic expression that play a role in closing the channels of water in the sky), this means rain is not as “natural water cycle”, but it is the result of a different process in the upper sky. These waves also have the ability to cause the forces of dissonance between the cloud particles, which leads to non-formation of clouds and thus to the spread of drought on Earth. This means the quantum emission has an “epigenetic” modification ability that affects the structure of the molecules among the two reacting mediums (the sequencing additional genomes as result to bio-transliteration reaction).</div><div>Wherefore, to learn how food affects the physiology of the individual as well as its role in communicating with the environment as shown by results of some studies below</div><div>“Nitric oxide (NO) plays an important role in various physiological processes in the kidney”(&lt;cite class="Itx_cote" data-bib-text="@articale{Ortiz, Pablo A, et al. 2002,</div><div>doi = {doi: 10.1152/ajprenal.00334},</div><div>url = {<a href="http://m.ajprenal.physiology.org/content/282/5/F777.short">http://m.ajprenal.physiology.org/content/282/5/F777.short</a>},</div><div>year = {2002},</div><div>month = {May},</div><div>Publisher = {AJP - Renal Physiol},</div><div>volume = {282},</div><div>number = {5},</div><div>pages = {F777--F784},</div><div>Author1 = {Ortiz, Pablo A},</div><div>author2 = {Jeffrey L.

Thus, (NO) as a chemical free radicals, works in delivering signals in plants and animals, as well as in humans, so it contains negative frequencies (by the food), further, that plays a role in climate change.</div><div>Another study showed that&nbsp; “It is suggested that utilization of exogenous purines may only occur in the intestinal mucosa and that the remaining purines may be completely converted, before entering the liver, to uric acid and allantoin, which are subsequently eliminated by the renal and extrarenal routes”(&lt;cite class="Itx_cote" data-bib-text="@articale{Vebric, J., et al. 1990,</div><div>doi = {<a href="https://doi.org/10.1017/S0021859600072610">https://doi.org/10.1017/S0021859600072610</a>}</div><div>url = {<a href="http://journals.cambridge.org/abstract_S0021859600072610">http://journals.cambridge.org/abstract_S0021859600072610</a>},</div><div>year = {1990},</div><div>Month = {June},</div><div>Publisher = {The Journal of Agricultural Science},</div><div>Volume = {114},</div><div>Issue = {03},</div><div>Pages = {243--248},</div><div>Author1 = {J.

In addition, there are free radicals produced, that accompanied by the emission of heart waves, (in the human body) as a result of eating some of the food, that have a role in communicating with the environment as well as there are waves emitted from the heart, which also play a vital role in the chemical atmosphere. Thus, man and through his daily practice, such as ethical work, food and drink, all lead to the generation of quantum energy in the heart, which have a role in the energy of the heart, whether electromagnetic that affect the surrounding environment or through the production of free radicals. Since the heart emits electromagnetic waves, it also emits ultrasonic waves.Thus, there is a consequence of sins as well as of good deeds and both play either positive or negative role in the Earth's climate and health process. In every heart there is a bio-compass that plays a role in guiding the behavior of the individual according to quantum accumulation. Furthermore, we must program a positive cardiac quantification through good food and away from predatory, unclean or dead meat. Because it accumulates in the heart and thus leads to micro-emission that affects on the climate. It also plays a guiding role in an individual's behavior towards anomalies or moderation. Consequently, the characteristics of violence, racism and crime arise as genetic traits are acquired from animals of jungle—according to coupling-complementary of molecules. It is assumed that if the family continues to eat donkey meat for a long time, it is likely to have negative genetic traits such as having sex with the mother or sister, as well as for eating dog meat, and so on. Therefore, the human genes must be preserved in pure condition.</div><div>&lt;h4&gt;Acknowledgments&lt;/h4&gt; This article written in Authorea.</div><div>&lt;h5&gt;Conflicts of Interest&lt;/h5&gt; The author declare no conflict of interest.</div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div>‏</div><div></div>
